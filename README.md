# ToxFam

**ToxFam** is a research-driven Python framework for classifying animal toxin protein sequences into families. It combines modern sequence embeddings, machine learning models, and curated preprocessing to improve protein family assignments in toxin datasets.

> **Note:** This project is under active development and not intended for external cloning, reuse, or contributions at this time.

## ðŸ§¬ Overview

ToxFam focuses on the high-quality classification of protein toxins by reducing sequence redundancy and enhancing label consistency. It supports workflows for:

- Sequence preprocessing and filtering
- Redundancy reduction via sequence similarity thresholds
- Label reassignment for ambiguous or mislabeled sequences
- Embedding generation using ProtT5
- Machine learning-based toxin family classification (via MLP)
